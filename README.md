## Download

Download the latest release zip from the Releases page, extract it, and run:

```text
ui\xm5ui.exe
```

Pair and connect the headphones in Windows Bluetooth settings first.

## Build

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Visual Studio C++ Build Tools for the native Bluetooth backend
- .NET Framework 4.x compiler, or Visual Studio Build Tools with C# support

Build everything and create a release zip:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-release.ps1 -Version v1.0
```

Build manually:

```bat
cd src\c
build.bat

cd ..\ui
build-ui.bat
```

The UI expects the backend at `..\c\xm5ctl.exe`, so keep the `c` and `ui` folders together.

## Notes

This project is not affiliated with Sony.

The app has no Bluetooth code of its own: every action runs `xm5ctl` once and
reads the result back from its output. Opening the headset's control channel is
the slow part of that, and how slow depends on what else is connected to the
headset — roughly 280 ms when the PC is its only link, and 1.8 s or more when a
phone is connected as well.

Waiting for a reply is the opposite: once the channel is open, an answer arrives
in milliseconds. The two therefore have separate budgets. `--connect-timeout`
covers opening the channel and defaults to 5000 ms; `--timeout` covers waiting
for an acknowledgement and a reply and defaults to 900 ms. A single shared value
cannot serve both — set low enough to keep the reply wait short it fails to
connect at all, and set high enough to connect it makes every unanswered command
wait that long. Commands the headset does not answer are normal rather than
exceptional, because a batch sweeps inquired types that not every model
implements.

Bluetooth control depends on Windows being able to open the headset's RFCOMM service. If commands fail, make sure the device is paired, connected, and selected as an audio device in Windows.
